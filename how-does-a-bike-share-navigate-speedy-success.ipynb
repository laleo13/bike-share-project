The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.\nThe analysis will be performed following 6 phases of the Data Analysis process: *Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, and Act (APPAA)*\n<a id=\"ask\"></a>\n\n\n# Ask\n**Business task**: Understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.\n\n**Key stakeholders**:\n- Lily Moreno - Director of Marketing - my manager\n- Cyclistic marketing analytics team\n- Cyclistic executive team\n\n**Deliverables**:\n- Insights on how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently\n- Provide effective visuals and relevant data to support insights\n- Use insights to give three recommendations to convert casual riders to member riders\n<a id=\"prepare\"></a>\n\n\n# Prepare\nThe data being used is the Divvy datasets which has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under [this license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). Cyclisitc is a fictional company hence using this public data to explore the different types of riders and their behaviours. Riders’ personally identifiable information has been removed from the data due to data privacy policies.\nAnalysis for this case study is made using data from February 2021 to February 2022, which is stored in separate files for each month. During the analysis, I stored original copies of the data on a secured hard drive, and worked with copies of the data on my pc.\nDue to the large size of the dataset I will be using R programming language because I can do data cleaning, analysis and visualizations on the same platform.\n<a id=\"process\"></a>\n\n\n\n# Process  \n<a id=\"problems\"></a>\n\n\n## Problems that need to be fixed\n- New columns that show more about day, month, year will be added for further aggregating  \n- `started_at` and `ended_at` need to be transformed to date and time format\n- Add a column that shows trip duration (in seconds) so we can use it for analyzing\n<a id=\"clean\"></a>\n\n\n## Perform cleaning data\nLoad the useful
